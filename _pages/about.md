I am a <strong>Postdoctoral Researcher</strong> in the <strong><a href="https://www.mpia.de/institute/scientific-departments/atmospheric-physics-of-exoplanets">Atmospheric Physics of Exoplanets (APEx) </a></strong> department at the <strong><a href="https://www.mpia.de/en">Max Planck Institute for Astronomy</a></strong> in Heidelberg, where I am part of the <strong><a href="https://www2.mpia-hd.mpg.de/~molliere/group/">atmospheric modelling and retrievals group</a></strong>. I focus on <strong>connecting theory to observations of exoplanets</strong> via different modelling techniques.

**Currently, I am developing and validating a retrieval framework for variable brown dwarfs and directly imaged planets.**
This framework is tested on GCM simulations, from which I generate synthetic observations to assess how accurately key atmospheric parameters can be retrieved from current data, including insights into the origin of atmospheric variability. 

In addition to this, **my experience includes testing atmospheric escape models for sub-Neptunes**, **constraining the compositions of small exoplanets**, and **atmospheric forward modelling** of directly imaged planets and brown dwarfs with complex cloud formation.

I hold a **joint PhD in Astrophysics** from the **University of Copenhagen** (Denmark) and the **Graz University of Technology** (Austria), completed in October 2024 as part of the <a href="https://chameleon.iwf.oeaw.ac.at/">CHAMELEON</a> Marie-Curie innovative training network. 

**If you're interested in collaborating or have GCM simulations you'd like to share for testing the retrieval framework, I'd love to hear from you!**
