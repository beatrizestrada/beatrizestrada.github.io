I am a portuguese exoplanet scientist, currently a postdoctoral reseacher at the <a href="https://www.mpia.de/institute/scientific-departments/atmospheric-physics-of-exoplanets">Atmospheric Physics for Exoplanet Atmospheres (APEx) </a> department at the <a href="https://www.mpia.de/en">Max Planck Institute for Astronomy</a> in Heidelberg. I am part of the <a href="https://www.mpia.de/en/apex/research/atmosphere-modeling">atmospheric modelling and retrieval group </a>.

My major research interest lies in linking theory to observations of exoplanets via different modelling techniques. My modelling efforts focus on obtaining constraints on relevant parameters to get us closer to understanding the still uncertain planet formation processes. My experience goes from testing atmospheric mass-loss models for sub-Neptunes, to modelling the smallest exoplanets in order to constrain their compositions, to modelling the atmospheres of self-luminous objects (directly imaged planets/brown dwarfs) with complex cloud formation.  

I attained a joint doctorate degree (PhD in Astrophysics/ Dr. rer. nat.) from the University of Copenhagen (Denmark) and the Graz University of Technology (Austria) in October 2024. During my PhD I was an early stage researcher at the <a href="https://chameleon.iwf.oeaw.ac.at/">CHAMELEON</a> Marie-Curie innovative training network. For more information see my <a hred="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15NRJTUM4HwLlCYNbRY0GrrjyxqZ2tK34/view?usp=sharing">CV</a>. 

You can find my PhD thesis here: <a href="https://nbi.ku.dk/english/theses/phd-theses/beatriz-maria-campos-estrada/Beatriz-Maria-Campos-Estrada.pdf">"From dusty tails to cloudy skies: exploring exoplanetary environments through self-consistent modelling"</a>.

If you are looking for someone enthusiastic to talk (almost) all things exoplanets, please feel free to reach out to me - I am available to have an informal chat or teach about what I know/do.
