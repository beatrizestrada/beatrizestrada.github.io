I am a portuguese exoplanet scientist, currently a postdoctoral reseacher at the <a href="https://www.mpia.de/institute/scientific-departments/atmospheric-physics-of-exoplanets">Atmospheric Physics for Exoplanet Atmospheres (APEx) </a> department at the <a href="https://www.mpia.de/en">Max Planck Institute for Astronomy</a> in Heidelberg. I am part of the <a href="https://www.mpia.de/en/apex/research/atmosphere-modeling">atmospheric modelling and retrieval group </a>.

My research spans over a diversity of topics within <b>exoplanet science</b>. My major research interest lies in linking theory to observations via modelling, with the goal of obtaining constraints on a diverse set of parameters to get us closer to understanding the still uncertain planet formation and planet evolution processes. I like all exoplanets - big or small, gaseous or rocky!

I attained a joint doctorate degree (PhD in Astrophysics/ Dr. rer. nat.) from the University of Copenhagen (Denmark) and the Graz University of Technology (Austria) in October 2024. During my PhD I was an early stage researcher at the <a href="https://chameleon.iwf.oeaw.ac.at/">CHAMELEON</a> Marie-Curie innovative training network.
My thesis titled "From dusty tails to cloudy skies: exploring exoplanetary environments through self-consistent modelling" can be found <a href="https://nbi.ku.dk/english/theses/phd-theses/beatriz-maria-campos-estrada/Beatriz-Maria-Campos-Estrada.pdf">here</a>.

If you are looking for someone enthusiastic to talk (almost) all things exoplanets, please feel free to reach out to me - I am available to have an informal chat or teach about what I know/do.

You can contact me at <b> <a href="mailto:becampos@mpia.de"> becampos@mpia.de</a></b>.
