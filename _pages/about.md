I am a <strong>Postdoctoral Researcher</strong> in the <strong><a href="https://www.mpia.de/institute/scientific-departments/atmospheric-physics-of-exoplanets">APEx</a></strong> department at the <strong><a href="https://www.mpia.de/en">Max Planck Institute for Astronomy</a></strong> in Heidelberg, where I am part of the <strong><a href="https://www2.mpia-hd.mpg.de/~molliere/group/">atmospheric modelling and retrievals group</a></strong>. I focus on <strong>connecting theory to observations of exoplanets</strong> via different modelling techniques.<br>

<p><strong>Currently, I am developing and validating a retrieval framework for variable brown dwarfs and directly imaged planets.</strong> This framework is tested on GCM simulations, from which I generate synthetic observations to assess how accurately key atmospheric parameters can be retrieved from current data, including insights into the origin of atmospheric variability. </p>

<p>In addition to this, <strong>my experience includes testing atmospheric escape models for sub-Neptunes, constraining the compositions of small exoplanets, and atmospheric forward modelling</strong> of directly imaged planets and brown dwarfs with complex cloud formation.</p>

<p>I hold a <strong>joint PhD in Astrophysics</strong> from the <strong>University of Copenhagen</strong> (Denmark) and the <strong>Graz University of Technology</strong> (Austria), completed in October 2024 as part of the <a href="https://chameleon.iwf.oeaw.ac.at/">CHAMELEON</a> Marie-Curie innovative training network. </p>

<p><strong>If you're interested in collaborating or have GCM simulations you'd like to share for testing the retrieval framework, I'd love to hear from you!</strong></p>
