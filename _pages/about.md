**I am a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="https://www.mpia.de/institute/scientific-departments/atmospheric-physics-of-exoplanets">Atmospheric Physics of Exoplanets (APEx) </a> department at the <a href="https://www.mpia.de/en">Max Planck Institute for Astronomy</a> in Heidelberg, where I am part of the <a href="https://www2.mpia-hd.mpg.de/~molliere/group/">atmospheric modelling and retrievals group</a>.**

**My major research interest lies in linking theory to observations of exoplanets via different modelling techniques.** My experience spans testing atmospheric escape models for sub-Neptunes, constraining the compositions of small exoplanets, and modelling the atmospheres of directly imaged planets and brown dwarfs with complex cloud formation.

I hold a joint PhD in Astrophysics from the University of Copenhagen (Denmark) and the Graz University of Technology (Austria), completed in October 2024 as part of the <a href="https://chameleon.iwf.oeaw.ac.at/">CHAMELEON</a> Marie-Curie innovative training network.

**You can find my PhD thesis here:** ***<a href="https://nbi.ku.dk/english/theses/phd-theses/beatriz-maria-campos-estrada/Beatriz-Maria-Campos-Estrada.pdf">From dusty tails to cloudy skies</a>***.
